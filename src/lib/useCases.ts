      {
        question: "What is security deposit automation for property managers?",
        answer:
          "It is a controlled move-out workflow that brings the deposit ledger, inspections, before-and-after evidence, invoices, policy context, deadlines, approvals, disposition output, delivery, refund status, and PMS writeback into one versioned case.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does AI decide security deposit deductions or refunds?",
        answer:

        question: "What happens when move-in photos or other required evidence are missing?",
        answer:
          "The case records an evidence gap and follows the operator's approved exception rule. AI must not infer the original condition, invent missing support, or convert a move-out image into proof of tenant responsibility.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens when the ledger balance and proposed refund do not reconcile?",
        answer:
          "The mismatch blocks approval, remains visible on the case, and routes to the designated accounting or management owner. The workflow should not generate a final disposition from unreconciled amounts.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does new evidence invalidate an earlier manager approval?",
        answer:
          "A manager approves an exact frozen proposal version. If evidence, policy context, charges, credits, or refund math materially changes, the workflow creates a new version and requires the configured review again.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can this connect to AppFolio or our existing property management system?",
        answer:
          "Yes, after the account's permissions and supported access path are verified. The workflow can use supported APIs, exports, inbox parsing, middleware, secure review queues, or manual writeback without promising unavailable direct access.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can the workflow use our current inspection or photo app?",
        answer:
          "Often, yes. The implementation first verifies how the tool exposes inspections, images, timestamps, signatures, reports, and source identifiers. It then uses the safest supported API, export, webhook, storage, or review-queue path.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is this the same as security deposit management software or a deposit alternative?",
        answer:
          "No. Deposit management platforms usually focus on collection, holding, interest, banking, and refunds, while deposit alternatives replace or reduce upfront cash. EMC2Ops focuses on the cross-system evidence, reconciliation, exception, approval, disposition, and audit workflow and can complement either category.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does EMC2Ops guarantee security deposit legal compliance?",
        answer:
          "No. The workflow uses the operator's counsel-approved policies, rule configuration, deadline sources, and human review gates. It provides operational controls and an audit trail, not legal advice or a substitute for counsel.",
      },
      {
        question: "How are state and local security deposit rules updated?",
        answer:
          "Each production rule should carry a jurisdiction, primary source, effective date, version, approver, and change history. A changed rule is reviewed and tested before activation, while existing cases preserve the exact rule version applied to them.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does the product send refunds automatically?",
        answer:
          "Not by default. It tracks the approved refund and fulfillment status. Moving money requires a separately approved payment integration, permissions, controls, reconciliation, and human authorization.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can security deposit automation work without bank-account access?",
        answer:
          "Yes. The workflow can stop at an approved disposition package and track a refund completed in the existing accounting or payment process. Bank or payment access is not required for the evidence and approval workflow.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does implementation take?",
        answer:
          "There is no responsible universal timeline. EMC2Ops confirms the implementation window after tracing a representative case and verifying systems, permissions, evidence rules, jurisdictions, approval roles, exception paths, testing, and any payment or delivery integrations.",

      {
        question: "How much does a security deposit automation workflow cost?",
